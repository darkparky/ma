      `Â· I recommend to use Official Telegram app for [Android](https://telegram.org/dl/android) or [iOS](https://telegram.org/dl/ios) instead of [X version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thunderdog.challegram&hl=en), Telegram beta is ok too.
  Because in X version (for Android, i don't have iOS device, so idk) pictures have worse quality than in Official one (for Android, i don't have iOS device, so idk, and yes, X version is official too, but it's _a slick experimental Telegram client based on TDLib._ [Here](https://telegram.org/apps#telegram-database-library-tdlib))

  _This message can be changed._`, {
